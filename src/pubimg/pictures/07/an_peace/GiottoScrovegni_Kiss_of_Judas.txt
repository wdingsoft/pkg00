Painted in the year 1306 by Giotto di Bondone, this painting depicts the moment of betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot who identifies Jesus to the Roman soldiers by kissing him. The Scrovegni Chapel is home to the fresco cycle by Giotto di Bondone, and the Kiss of Judas is the most famous painting in the cycle. Many critics believe that Giotto is a genius and no artist has been able to surpass his work. His mastery is evident in the way he captured the expression of Jesus and Judas at that scene of betrayal.
