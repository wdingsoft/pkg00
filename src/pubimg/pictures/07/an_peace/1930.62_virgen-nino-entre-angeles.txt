The Master of the André Madonna, an anonymous painter active in Bruges in the early 16th century, derives his name from a panel in the Musée Jacquemart André in Paris depicting the Virgin, slightly over half-length, against a landscape background. The artist’s style reflects the influence of Jan van Eyck and Petrus Christus as well as that of his contemporary Gerard David. The present work is inspired by The Virgin and Child by Petrus Christus, now in the Szépmüveszeti Museum in Budapest, which in turn looks to Van Eyck’s celebrated Virgin of the Fountain (Musée Royal des Beaux-Arts, Antwerp). In the present composition the artist included four musical angels, two at the bottom and two at the top, that are not to be found in the painting by Christus, and replaced the landscape background with a view of the city of Bruges with the cathedral of Our Lady. This painting also reveals certain parallels with a panel by Gerard David of the same subject, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.
