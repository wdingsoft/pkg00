Madonna and Child with the Holy Trinity and Two Saints is a painting by Luca Signorelli, from 1510, now in the Uffizi in Florence. It is a sacra conversazione, with the Madonna enthroned between Michael and Gabriel, with Augustine (left) and Athanasius (right) below and the Holy Trinity above.[1]

It was originally commissioned by the Confraternity of the Trinity for pilgrims in Cortona, the town where Signorelli was born and produced several works.[2] It was later in the San Niccol√≤ Monastery in Cafaggio from 1810 to 1919.[3] Its predella included scenes of The Wedding at Cana, Christ at Gethsemane and The Flagellation of Christ - it was detached and moved to the Galleria dell'Accademia, also in Florence.[4]
