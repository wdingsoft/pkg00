Catalogue note
This small altarpiece was probably once the left leaf of a diptych depicting the Virgin annunciate in the roundel of its counterpart, as pointed out by Carlo Volpe in his letter to the owner dated 26 December 1967. We are grateful to Dr Gaudenz Freuler for his comments on the attribution of the painting, which has suffered substantial damage and restoration notwithstanding the original quality still discernible in some areas. MA-XRF images are available on request.
