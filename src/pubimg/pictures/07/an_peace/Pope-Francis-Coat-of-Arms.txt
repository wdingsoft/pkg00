Extract
Pope Francis' Coat of Arms
Pope Francis’ Coat of Arms
Jesus said to Simon Peter, “I will give you the keys to the Kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven”. (Matthew 16:19)

Thought

My dream is to be like St Peter and one day, enter the Kingdom of Heaven to a chorus of celebration from the Angels and Saints. (Anne: 9yrs)
