			Buddhism started as a Hindu influenced religion in India. Details about Buddha&rsquo;s life and original teachings as presented in the first century BC Buddhist scriptures are important for understanding how Chinese Buddhism developed. Guatama Buddha was the founder of the religion. He lived between 600 and 400 BC. Buddha and his followers left no writings, but his rules for monastic life and teachings were memorized and passed down by oral tradition until about the second century BC when the first Buddhist scriptures were written. The oral tradition was corrupted. Shortly after this, the first scriptures were brought to China.</p>

			Buddhism as taught in the first scriptures of about the second century BC say that Buddha taught &ldquo;Four Noble Truths:&rdquo; Suffering is a part of existence; the origin of suffering is craving for sensuality, acquisition of identity, and annihilation; suffering can be ended; and following the Noble Eightfold Path is the means to accomplish this. The Noble Eightfold Path is: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. He emphasized ethics and understanding. He stated that there is no intermediary between mankind and the divine.</div>

			Early Chinese Buddhism</div>
		<div>
			Buddhist teachers may have arrived in the third century BC because there is evidence that the Qin Emperor ordered the destruction of the religion about 213 BC. At the time that the first Buddhist scriptures came to China, the Han Empire existed. After it fell, there were separate kingdoms and other empires that had their own religions and different degrees of contact with Buddhists in Central Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Different kinds of Buddhism developed in these countries, and their teachings were changed by Chinese</span>, so the religious history is complex with many different sects. Sometimes the religion and Buddhists were supported and sponsored by the rulers during the past 2000 years, and sometimes Buddhists were eradicated and temples and scriptures were destroyed to make people not believe it.</div>

			Initially, Buddhism in China faced a number of difficulties in becoming established. The concept of monasticism and the aversion to social affairs seemed to contradict the long-established norms and standards established in Chinese society. Some even declared that Buddhism was harmful to the authority of the state, that Buddhist monasteries contributed nothing to the economic prosperity of China, that Buddhism was barbaric and undeserving of Chinese cultural traditions.[10] However, Buddhism was often associated with Daoism in its ascetic meditative tradition, and for this reason a concept-matching system was used by some early Indian translators, to adapt native Buddhist ideas onto Daoist ideas and terminology.[11][12]</div>

			Buddhism appealed to Chinese intellectuals and elites and the development of gentry Buddhism was sought as an alternative to Confucianism and Daoism, since Buddhism&#39;s emphasis on morality and ritual appealed to Confucianists and the desire to cultivate inner wisdom appealed to Daoists. Gentry Buddhism was a medium of introduction for the beginning of Buddhism in China, it gained imperial and courtly support. By the early 5th century Buddhism was established in south China.[13] During this time, Indian monks continued to travel along the Silk Road to teach Buddhism, and translation work was primarily done by foreign monks rather than Chinese.</div>

			No such manuscripts were known, however, when Muller produced his edition. The first to come to light was the Central Asia ms discovered by Sir Aurel Stein in the remains of a dwelling at Dandan Uiliq in Eastern Turkestan in December 1900, and identified by Rudolf Hoernle in 1903 as a copy of the Vaj. It was not until 1916 that Pargiter published a full edition of this ms. According to Pargiter, it dates from the end of the fifth century or the beginning of the sixth century, and represents a text which, at least in terms of contents, is fairly close to the Chinese translation by Kumarajiva(401 CE)</p>

			The second ancient ms of the Vaj to ppear was found among the 15 or so Mhayana sutras, some of them in multiple copies, which were discoverd along with a large number of other Buddhist text in the remains of a tower-like building near Naupur, three miles north of Gilgit, in Pakistan, in 1931. They include severn folios of the Vaj, dating to the 6th or 7th century, which were eventually published in 1974.</p>
