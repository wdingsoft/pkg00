Description Additional information
The Qijia Culture is named after the Qijiaping Site in Gansu Province, China. The culture was distributed around the upper Yellow river region of Gansu (centered in Lanzhou) and eastern Qinghai The Qijia people lived in large villages in terraces along the river and buried their dead in pits. The dominant characteristic of the culture appears to have been comblike designs and amphora-like vases and their most common implements were stone axes and rectangular knives, although small copperware items were also widely used. The Qijia culture pottery is rare compared to the other Chinese Neolithic ceramic and most of the known Qijia culture pottery artefacts are not very tall.
