Description Additional information
The Majiayao Culture was one of the most important Neolithic cultures in Chinese prehistory, developing along the Yellow River from the 6th millennium BC. The Majiayao culture is especially well-known for its mass production of pottery. Majiayao artisans had no knowledge of the potter’s wheel; therefore their pottery production was entirely handmade. The pottery was formed by stacking coils of clay into the desired shape and smoothing the surfaces with paddles and scrapers. Majiyao pottery production appears to be less carefully painted trough time. This has been explained by the increasing use of pottery offerings in burials, forcing Chinese artisans to work much quicker on the vessels.
